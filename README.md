# sign_language_fingerspelling_recognition_system
This A-Level Computer Science project uses Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and NumPy to develop a Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition System. Achieving 95.3% accuracy, it employs a CNN trained on 7,000+ hand signs for real-time recognition via webcam. Robustness was enhanced with data augmentation, earning 100% coursework marks.
