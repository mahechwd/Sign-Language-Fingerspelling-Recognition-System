## 🔬 Project Overview 📝

- Building a robust sign language recognition system requires accurate hand detection, feature extraction, and classification. This project implements a complete pipeline for recognizing fingerspelled letters in real-time.

- Refer to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-recognition) for the complete code.

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing 📸**
   - 1.1 Collect hand gesture images using [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) for hand landmark detection and **OpenCV** for video processing
   
   - 1.2 Create a diverse dataset covering various hand sizes, skin tones, and lighting conditions:

3. **Feature Extraction & Processing 🔍**
   - 2.1 **Landmark detection**: Use MediaPipe Hands to extract 3D hand landmarks (21 points per hand)
   
   - 2.2 **Feature engineering**: Calculate relative distances, angles, and positional features from landmarks
   
   - 2.3 **Normalization**: Scale and rotate hand positions for orientation invariance
   
   - 2.4 Each frame produces a feature vector representing hand configuration ✋

4. **Model Architecture 🧠**

6. **Training Pipeline ☁️**
   - The system uses [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for model training, with options for both cloud and local training environments
   - Data augmentation techniques include rotation, scaling, and background variation to improve generalization
   - Hyperparameter tuning performed using validation split and cross-validation techniques

## Dataset Construction 🗂️

1. The **input features** are [hand_landmarks, relative_distances, angles]. The processed data contains normalized spatial information about hand configuration.

2. The **output labels** are [letter_class, confidence] representing recognized alphabet letters and prediction confidence scores.

3. **Data balancing** techniques applied to ensure equal representation of all letters in the alphabet.

4. **Temporal processing**: For continuous recognition, implement sliding window approach to analyze gesture sequences over time.

5. **Real-time Optimization ⚡**
