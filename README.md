# Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition System
The **Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition System**, developed as part of my A-Level Computer Science coursework, is designed to bridge communication gaps for the deaf community and support learners in mastering fingerspelling. Built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **NumPy**, the system achieves real-time gesture recognition through a CNN trained on a custom dataset. Features include real-time feedback, gesture accuracy visualization, and a learning environment with interactive exercises.  

NOTE: Unfortunately, the project’s code and trained model were lost due to hardware failure, but the entire development process was meticulously documented. This includes detailed research, a code appendix, and implementation steps within my report, ensuring the project’s methodology and impact are preserved. I plan to further develop this project in the future.
